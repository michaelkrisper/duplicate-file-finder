Ok - some possible fixes/changes for you.

- changed it from -

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    to

    #!/usr/bin/env python3


    My system still has python ==> python2... perhaps old, whatever.

- the default scan type is -fast. Except... it's not, you always do both. The guilty lines are:

    if method == "fast":
        iterations.append((partial(get_hash_key, partial=True), "By Partial Hash", top*2 if top else None))
    iterations.append((get_hash_key, "By Full Hash", None))

    
    This also causes the hashes to be wrong if --fast is chosen (well, it'll calc once as partial, then again as full.

- Made "thorough" the default. Debatable, but unless you're doing mega amounts of files, --fast doesn't give you all that much given the new speed increases. And personally I wouldn't trust --fast for much of anything. YMMV :)

  I could almost see the --fast option being useful if you could choose the chunk size... not a big deal, code-wise, but not going to do that now since you've hardcoded 1024 around. But the first time I ran this 

- gave all the args short versions... and changed -fast to --fast. E.g. "-e" and "--empty", etc. I'd never use the longer ones if I could help it!

- killed the "--method" option (bonus - this frees -m for --min-file-size :)). You have a --fast option already... I never understood why one might specify the default (obv this is the same if you only had --thorough or w/e as an option and "fast" as the default.)

- Merged UpdatePrinter.py into main program. I think it's less than 20 lines, and allows you to put the file whereever (/usr/local/bin, etc.)

- changed the output to be full pathname vs. relative... less of an issue before, but now with multiple directories...! Even with a single dir checked, it's more useful this way, IMHO.
